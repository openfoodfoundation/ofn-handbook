# The team

As we explain later in this guidebook, people can contribute on the local level \(facilitating a local OFN community\) or at global level. At global level, we are building a team of certified contributors, who have gone through the [onboarding process](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-contributor-guide/working-on-the-ofn-governance/onboarding-process) \(most of them where there before this process was even built actually!\). Some are paid contributors, others can afford and have chosen to remain volunteer contributors, but all people in the certified team are involved on a daily basis.

Here is the list of the main OFN global certified contributors:
