# Team organization

The OFN global team is composed of:  
- **developers and user experience designers**, who have more a technical background. They manage the OFN code base and administrate the servers for local instances.  
- **product owners, testers, and project coordinators** who have more a customer, product strategy and project management view.  
- **content producers** working more on communication and sector development side.

Among those contributors, some are occasional contributors, and other work on a daily basis on the OFN project and are called "**the core certified team**".

The processes below explain how new contributors join and exit the core team, and how and how much they are paid.

For developers, this process has been specified with some technical commitments [on this wiki page](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki/Pipeline-development-process).
