# Software improvement process

There are four type of improvement that we need to deal with in parallel:  
- fix the **bugs**  
- develop **new features to satisfy needs** **that are not yet satisfied**  
- follow the **upgrades of the "modules" we have built our software on** \(called "dependencies"\). If we don't do it, we accumulate what we call a "**tech debt**", that we will anyway ned to deal with sometime. If we don't do it regularly, then we have do pay the interests of not having done it.  
- improve the **administration system setup** to make upgrades and maintenance of the local platforms easier.
