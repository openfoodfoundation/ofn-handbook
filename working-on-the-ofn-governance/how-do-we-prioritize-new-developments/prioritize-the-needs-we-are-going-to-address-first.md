# Report and curate bugs

There is no software without bugs. We just need a process to report and fix bugs efficiently. Not all bugs are equivalent, some really prevent the use of the platform and should be addressed as soon as possible. Others are small bugs that are not really annoying, we can live with them, users may not even have noticed them.

### **1- What is a bug?**

We regularly have people opening issues on Github saying they are bug, but in fact they talk about a new feature not yet implemented. Bugs are only gaps between how a feature is supposed to work ALREADY, and how it works ACTUALLY.

### **2- What to do if you identify a bug?**

Open an issue on Github. When you create an issue, you will see a default template guiding you to report that bug. We have worked on a [five level priority list](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki/Bug-severity), please always affect a priority level to a bug, that will help us curate them! 

### **3- How do we curate bugs?**

The train drivers of the OFN will treat the new bugs the following way:  
a- For s1 or s2 bugs \(most severe bugs\), as soon as the bug is reported, they will add a message on the \#bugs channel on Slack to make sure the first developer available work on it as soon as possible and will put the issue at the top of the dev-ready column.  
b- For s3 and lower, each core instance get to choose their most pressing bugs at a regular pace. Train drivers are responsible for making sure bugs are selected and tackle regularly
