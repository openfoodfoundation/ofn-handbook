# Brainstorm solutions, choose one and implement it

When we have this TOP10 needs identified, we need to organize brainstormings about the potential solutions that could enable us to satisfy the top prioritized needs. Probably, this will have started already when specifying the need, as people will start with solutions instead of needs ;-\) But we need to do some proper brainstorming to open our mind and not get stuck with the first solution that came to our mind.

**Every need will be assigned to a "product owner", and when a feature candidate has been selected, this feature candidate will be assigned to a "product owner" AND a "tech owner"**. They are responsible to organize the solution discovery and inception process, that will go through the following steps. You can see the[ corresponding template here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6vvwH3KAyx839Q_sfW6sW3Cs49ZjFBqi8Nzatmg7As/edit?usp=sharing)

### 1- Brainstorm potential solutions to meet the need

That means listing all the possible solutions to answer the need. Those potential solutions are called **"feature candidates"**. This is mostly a "product owner" job, but tech can also help in identifying feature candidates to meet the need.

### 2- Choose our preferred solution

For each potential solution, we evaluate the easyness level and value level, and map the feature candidates in a **value/ease matrix.** Having a tech prospective is important here as product people won't know how hard it is to implement feature candidate A or B. So product owner needs to make sure she includes tech in that work.

That will help us choose the feature candidate that enable us to get enough value to meet the need, and that will request the less work for that. Basically we will tend to choose a feature candidate that add the more value regarding the need, and enough value for the need to be met, at the lower cost possible. This feature candidate is then called **"selected feature candidate"**.

When a feature candidated has been selected for a given need, the "product owner" for the need is in charge of **opening an epic on Github and add it to the "**[**product feature backlog**](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/projects/19)**" project board in the "backlog" column**. When the[ curation team](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-contributor-guide/~/drafts/-LJJegY9nhcItdnde4Bb/primary/working-on-the-ofn-governance/how-do-we-prioritize-new-developments/manage-the-delivery-pipeline) have gathered and decided to enter that feature in the development pipeline, they will assign a "tech owner" to that feature, depending on the availablility of the developers at that moment.

### 3- Incept the selected solution

When we have chosen the feature we want to implement, we need to **incept** it: understand with devs the technical constraints, draw the user flow and mockups \(how we want this new feature to look like\), break the job to be done into small stories and order them into a **"story map"**, plan how we are going to release the new feature, how we communicate about it with users.

The product owner of the feature is in charge of facilitating that process along with the tech owner, and **communicating all that work by specifying the epic in the product feature backlog**.

### 4- Implement the solution

The product owner might want at that stage to **open a dedicated project board** to be able to follow the implementation process of that specific feature.

When we have this story map, the product owner will feed the delivery pipeline with new issues picking them in those story maps, in order to make sure the features are released as quickly and efficiently as possible.
