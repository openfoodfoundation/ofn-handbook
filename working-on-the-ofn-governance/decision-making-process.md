# Decision making process

How do we take collectively decisions in a Distributed Collaborative Organization?

**What type of decisions do we need to take at global level?**  
- Decisions about how we work together, our processes and the evolution of those processes  
- Decisions about the priorities we are going to work on to improve the OFN software  
- Decisions about who joins or exits the global OFN certified contributors team \(who we start to collectively pay at the global level\)  
- Decisions about new affiliates joining the network  
- Decisions about projects we might want to build together...

The decisions regarding the OFN software improvement follow a specific process described [here](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-contributor-guide/~/drafts/-LJOxw66B48qshQ8IeVo/primary/working-on-the-ofn-governance/how-do-we-prioritize-new-developments).  
The ones regarding who joins the certified contributor team is explained in our onboarding process.

For all the other decisions, the **usual decision making process is**:  
- we open a thread on our [community forum](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/) to make a proposal to evolve a process, or about a new project or idea for the future, so people can contribute and react  
- there will be discussions until we reach some form of **lazy consent**. So if there is no objections, usually things will happen if the leader of the conversation carry on the project of course!  
- some decisions about exclusion of contributors for instance would happen in Slack in a private channel with only the core certified team of very active contributors.
