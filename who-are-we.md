# What is the OFN in brief?

Open Food Network \(OFN\) is a collaborative global network of local non-profit organisations who codevelop open source software and make it available to food hubs worldwide through localized online platforms \(like [OFN UK](https://openfoodnetwork.org.uk/), [OFN Australia](http://openfoodnetwork.org.au/), [Open Food France](http://openfoodfrance.org/), [Katuma](http://katuma.org/) , [OFN Canada](https://openfoodnetwork.ca/), etc.\). The mission of this community is to build a shared digital infrastructure \(and shared knowledge\) to enable short food chain operators to manage their activities, cooperate more efficiently, and build food sovereignty. Just as consumers and producers come together to create food hubs, in OFN food hubs come together to create digital infrastructure and share the use of it.

In practice, the platform enables producers to manage their product catalogue and share them with multiple distributors \(food hubs\). Hubs can connect with one or multiple producers to list their products in a shop and organize collective sales, and get aggregated data to organize logistics and fulfil bulk or individual orders.

In OFN, a hub can be many different things, including:  
- a producer selling directly to consumers through an online shop  
- a CSA or buying group organizing regular collective purchases, which can be subscription-based, and can handle multiple sub-purchase groups  
- an entrepreneur sourcing food from local/organic producers and organizing sales to individuals, groups, restaurants, retailers

The platform also enables networking and marketing features, like the possibility to create a ‘group’ with producers and hubs of a specific ecosystem displayed on a map, as the[ Biodynamic Association in UK](https://www.biodynamic.org.uk/where-to-buy/) did.
