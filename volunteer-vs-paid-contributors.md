\#\#2-The rates for certified contributors

The philosophy behind the redistribution process is that the value generated by the project should be distributed fairly to those who contributed to create the value. Inspired by the contributive/value accounting, our aim is to set up a retribution system that is not “equal” but “fair” and take into account:

* **the difference of value created by an OFN junior or senior dev in one hour**
  . For that we are inspired by the Japanese “ShuHaRi” experience level system. “Shu” is a beginner, “Ha” intermediate and “Ri” master. Those are level in mastering an art. It seems fair that a “Shu” is not paid as much as a “Ri” as with the same time spent, the “Ri” will create more value for the project than a “Shu”.
* **the cost of living of contributors**
  . It is not fair that a dev who live in a very expensive city is paid the same as a dev working in a small countryside where rents are much cheaper for instance. Or devs in India and Australia.
 
  I suggest on that point to use
  [**the cost of living index**](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp)
  . This is given by country, but it is also possible to
  [compare between cities](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/comparison.jsp)
  .
 
  I suggest we stick to three cost of living categories to start with and iterate on the first cases.

A first discussion were held on the topic[here](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/t/the-rates-people-are-paid-building-a-fair-retribution-system/893)  
I updates[the rates table2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGJgoivBFsQ5zWgV7e2wSSmJCjRuWEBGhxrMowS96co/edit#gid=743951692)with a Shuhari tab and a first propoal as a base for discussion. We will need people from those different catergories to see if that seems fair. Here is what it could look like:
